            <p class="bg-red-300 p-4">Answer : <u>map()</u> executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. <br><u>.filter()</u> checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br><u>.forEach()</u> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br><u>.find()</u> is used to select a single element from an array.</p>

            <p class="bg-red-300 p-4">Answer : <u>local storage</u> is a way to store data on the client’s computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data. <br><u>session storage</u> stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closeddata is never transferred to the server can only be read on client-side storage limit is about 5-10MB  opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window. <br><u>cookies</u> stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side . Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.Size must be less than 4KB.
            Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie.</p>

            <p class="bg-red-300 p-4">Answer : <u>Event Loop</u> is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty. <br>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
